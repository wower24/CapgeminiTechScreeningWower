# Phone shop task for Capgemini Technical Screening
<br><br>
This is a console application simulating kind of a phone shop database.
There is possibility to add a phone, delete a phone by index and print reports.

However, I did not have enough time to allow the user to choose between reports (the functions are ready, you just can't call them yet),
I also missed the top-3 part of screen sizes popularity so it would print just the most popular one.
Unfortunately, at the end some Linker error (realted to using header files incorrectly, I bet) defeated me, I could not fix it before the deadline.

Thank you for taking the time to check my task,
Kind Regards.
